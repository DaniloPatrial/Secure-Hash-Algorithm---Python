# Python Secure Hash Standard Implementation

This project provides a Python implementation of the Secure Hash Standard (SHS), which specifies four secure hash algorithms: SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. The implementation is based on the specifications defined in the NIST FIPS PUB 180-4 document.

The Secure Hash Standard (SHS) is a cryptographic standard that provides guidelines for securely hashing data. Each algorithm in the standard (SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512) produces a unique and irreversible fixed-length hash value, ensuring data integrity and security in various applications.
